PRE-INSTALL:

	To compile ghc you need a working ghc compiler. Install ghc-binary port
	for the build process. After you have build ghc from source, remove the
	ghc-binary port, then install ghc.

	You will no longer need to use ghc-binary as long as you have ghc
	installed.

	Example of the workflow:

	# prt-get depinst ghc-binary
	# prt-get install ghc --config-append="addcommand true"
	# prt-get remove ghc-binary
	# prt-get install ghc
